          This is my first solo project. I chose this one so that I could learn how to use 2-dimensional arrays. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I also chose to challenge myself by not using any hardcoded HTML and used elements created in JS since I knew that I would be using react later and thought that it would help with keeping track of pieces of information while thinking.

        <p>
          I learned that I should definitely figure out how to approach the problem I have in concept before I start working on it on my computer.
          I began mixing up a lot of my code and functionalities so I decided that maybe I should tackle on bigger concepts and go down to the very fine details. 
          This project taught me how to use the debugger in chrome.

            This project was the first project I completed with React. I wanted to learn how to use a lot of numerical data and then display them on screen in a way that anyone could understand without reading through 100 lines of numbers.

          In this project I learned a lot about how to use third party API's and how to choose which features and pieces I would need and or want to implement.
          I also learned about npm libraries that I could use. Because I had to read the libraries documentation and the API's documentation I learned how to navigate through large amounts of information efficiently.

            This was the group project assigned to us in General Assembly. I was the "Git Tsar" for my team.<br><br>
            This led to me being in charge of keeping everyone in tune as to how to use git and github and collaborate as well as accepting or rejecting pull requests. <br><br>
            This slowly turned to me being the unofficial leader of the group where I would suggest things we have to work on or want to work on and then delegate them according to the teams preferences and capabilities.

          As the git tsar I learned a lot about how to use git and collaborate using it as well as keeping track of app versions so that I could explain these concepts to my teammates and make sure they were always on the same page. 
          I also learned a lot about maintaining a good team atmosphere especially during a very stressful time.

            This project was our final solo project within General Assembly. <br><br>
            I chose to make a single website to have different levels of authorization. For example some people could only read posts others have full CRUD on posts etc. depending on your type of authorization.

          I learned about how to use more pieces of information in my databases. 
          I used to only use very minimal/simple information and every feature would be one dimensional.
