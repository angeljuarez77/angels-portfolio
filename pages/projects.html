          This is my first solo project. I chose this one so that I could learn how to use 2-dimensional arrays. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I also chose to challenge myself by not using any hardcoded HTML and used elements created in JS since I knew that I would be using react later and thought that it would help with keeping track of pieces of information while thinking.

          This project was the first project I completed with React. I wanted to learn how to use a lot of numerical data and then display them on screen in a way that anyone could understand without reading through 100 lines of numbers.

          This was the group project assigned to us in General Assembly. I was the "Git Tsar" for my team.<br><br>
          This led to me being in charge of keeping everyone in tune as to how to use git and github and collaborate as well as accepting or rejecting pull requests. <br><br>
          This slowly turned to me being the unofficial leader of the group where I would suggest things we have to work on or want to work on and then delegate them according to the teams preferences and capabilities.

          This project was our final solo project within General Assembly. <br><br>
          I chose to make a single website to have different levels of authorization. For example some people could only read posts others have full CRUD on posts etc. depending on your type of authorization.
