          My name is Angel and I am a fullstack web developer. I developed all my web developing skills by going through Per Scholas' codebridge program and General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. I have experience with  HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Express.js, Postgres, and Sequelize.

          I used to work at a yoga studio called Sweet Water Dance & Yoga in the Bronx. During the summer I was a senior counselor in the Roots & Rivers program in this location and during the other 3 seasons I would just volunteer and help maintaing a clean environment and set up for classes as well as tend to the front desk by suggesting dance and or yoga lessons to curious customers.
