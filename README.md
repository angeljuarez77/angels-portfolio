# angels-portfolio

This is the repository to ['angeljuarez.net'](http://angeljuarez.net/).

In my mind this is where I show the world what I'm working on and what I'm trying to learn (if I'm not too busy to update it). Please feel free to browse my multiple branches and give me suggestions on coding quality. 

I use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
